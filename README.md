# Overlook 

This application allows users to search and book rooms at the "Overlook Hotel". Users can sign in with a username and password, then see their current and past bookings on a dashboard, along with the total amount of money spent on bookings so far. Bookings are divided on the page between past and current bookings, based on the current date. Users can book new rooms by using the search feature, and can filter results based on room type.

## Learning Goals
This was my final project for Mod 2 in the Turing School of Software Engineering front end program. The goal was to create an application that uses TDD or test driven development, and that can fetch data and post data to a local server through API endpoints, while writing DRY (do not repeat yourself) and SRP (single responsibility purpose) code.
